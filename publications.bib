abstract={The UML syntactic notation used in texts, papers, documentation and CASE tools is often different, despite UML being considered a software engineering standard. Our initial empirical study considered variations in the notation used for UML class diagrams; the experiment reported concentrates on UML collaboration diagrams. The decision as to which of the semantically equivalent notational variations within the UML standard to use appears to be according to the personal preference of the author or publisher, rather than based on any consideration of the ease with which the notation can be understood by human readers. This paper reports on an experiment that takes a human comprehension perspective on UML collaboration diagrams. Five notations were considered: for each, two semantically equivalent (yet syntactically or stylistically different), variations were chosen from published texts. Our experiment required subjects to indicate whether a supplied pseudo-code specification matched each of a set of experimental UML collaboration diagrams. The results reveal that our informal, personal intuitions (which were based on our view of the complexity of the notation) are validated with respect to confirming that a specification matches a diagram, but not when errors in a diagram are to be identified. The subjects' preferences are in favour of the more concise notational variants.},

abstract = "Well-defined symbolic notations are essential for communication between teams of people working on any application. For large software implementations, \{UML\} is commonly used; for databases, entity relationship (ER) diagrams are useful. However, the form of notation used in texts, papers, and documentation and learning materials is often different, and tends to reflect the personal preference of the author or publisher. The choice between semantically equivalent notations does not appear to be based on any consideration of the ease with which human readers could understand the notation. This paper addresses this notation comprehension issue by proposing an experimental methodology for determining which of two complete notations is easier to comprehend. The methodology also allows individual notational variants to be targeted. This methodology has been applied to two types of \{ER\} notations: our experiment required subjects to indicate whether a supplied textual specification of objects and relationships matched each of a set of Chen (Chen, \{ACM\} Trans. Database Systems 1 (1976) 9) and \{SSADM\} (Weaver, Practical \{SSADM\} Version 4-A Complete Tutorial Guide, Pitman, London, 1993) \{ER\} diagrams. The results reveal both better performance and higher preference for the more concise overall notation, with partial results with respect to individual variants within the notations. "

abstract={Many applications for robotics require that the robot know its current position in the environment. While there exist several solutions for localizing a robot, even in a previously unknown environment, they often require an estimate of the robot's motion. However, in many situations, a robot may not have motion encoders, or its encoders may be highly inaccurate. We have developed an algorithm for tracking the position of a robot, based on a rangeflnder device, that is robust to temporary errors in the range scan. By aligning each scan to an occupancy grid of prior scan data, we can find the robot's position more accurately than current techniques which only align to the previous scan. In addition, our solution can track the position of the robot based on three dimensional scan data, instead of requiring that the range sensor be fixed in a level plane.},

abstract={Advances in sensing technology and algorithm design make it possible for a robot equipped with a laser range-finder to generate a map and localise itself within the map as the robot explores its environment.We describe a system for mapping and virtual reconstruction developed as part of a robot for urban search and rescue. The process of mapping and, at the same time, localising the robot within the map, is called Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). In many applications, such as urban search and rescue, information from wheel encoders is inaccurate and cannot be used for odometry to obtain a position estimate. However, iterative closest point scan matching algorithms make it possible for a robot to perform accurate positioning in unstructured environments where wheel slip is common. When this positioning is combined with a mapping algorithm such as FastSLAM, the robot can construct an accurate map in real-time as it moves. Given the generated map and the robot's position within it, a variety of exploration algorithms allow the robot to autonomously explore its environment. The robot is also equipped with an RGB-D camera. The 3D information as well as the colour video images are incorporated into the map to produce a 3D virtual reconstruction of the environment as the robot explores. This robot won the award for best autonomous robot in three successive RoboCup Rescue Robot competitions [1], 2009 - 2011.},

abstract={Learning a map of an unknown environment and localising a robot in it is a common problem in robotics, with solutions usually requiring an estimate of the robot's motion. In scenarios such as Urban Search and Rescue, motion encoders can be highly inaccurate, and weight and battery requirements often limit computing power. We have developed a GPU based algorithm using Iterative Closest Point position tracking and Graph SLAM that can accurately generate a map of an unknown environment without the need for motion encoders and requiring minimal computational resources. The algorithm is able to correct for drift in the position tracking by rapidly identifying loops and optimising the map. We present a method for refining the existing map when revisiting areas to increase the accuracy of the existing map and bound the run-time to the size of the environment.},
