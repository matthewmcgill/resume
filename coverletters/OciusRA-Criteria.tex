\section{Research Experience}

My research experience invloves a number of jobs at the University of New South Wales(UNSW) and the University of Queensland(UQ).  This is as both a research assistant at UQ and a researcher at UNSW.

\section{Development Experience in Multiple OSs}

I have developed software in multiple languages for a number of operating systems. I have produced applications in C/C++, Java and Python that run on Windows, Linux and OS X.

\section{C/C++ Skills}

I have worked on a number of software tools that were written in C/C++.  These include a speech recognition server and multiple systems running on autonomous vehicles. 

\section{Knowledge of Autonomous Vehicles}

I have worked with a variety of autonomous and semi-autonomous robots.  This includes representing UNSW at RoboCup as part of team CASualty in the Rescue Robot League.
This involved working with both wheeled and tracked robots.  I have also worked with humanoid robots such as the soccer playing Naos and the research oriented Baxter robot. 

\section{Sailing Experience}

I have spent 3 months working with Ocius on an unmanned sailing vessel.  Prior to this as a child I spent many days sailing on my family's catamaran.
